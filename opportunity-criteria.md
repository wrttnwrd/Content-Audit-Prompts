## Opportunity Criteria

I may provide additional criteria in my prompt, but always consider these factors:

In the Lost Traffic By Page sheet:

1. Declining performance as indicated by active visitors, views, and/or engaged sessions. 
2. Look for pages in the top 50% for pageviews, key events, or other engagement that have declined in any of those categories

In the ScreamingFrog sheet:

1. High semantic similarity to other content. If pages have > .95 semantic similarity to other pages, this may mean we can roll up multiple pieces of content into one, more useful one. if that's the case, show me the similar pages
2. High visits, low engaged sessions. This may mean the page is capturing interest but not conversions
3. High impressions and/or ranking, low CTR and/or clicks may mean the content ranks well but doesn't match searcher intent
4. Weak similarity to keywords in the Keyword List sheet, if there is one
5. Look at link score - if I can boost a page's performance and/or visibility by adding some links, that's an opportunity
6. If a page is an opportunity, check for a lack of H2s or H1s
7. Also look for high reading difficulty, where reading difficulty is higher than the site average

This list is suggestions. It is not exclusive. If you see other data indicating an opportunity, tell me.
