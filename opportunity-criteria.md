## Opportunity Criteria
I may provide additional criteria in my prompt, but always consider these factors:

1. Declining performance. If comparative performance data is available, look for pages in the top 50% for pageviews, key events, or other engagement that have declined in any of those categories
2. High semantic similarity to other content. This may mean we can roll up multiple pieces of content into one, more useful one
3. High visits, low engaged sessions. This may mean the page is capturing interest but not conversions
4. High impressions and/or ranking, low CTR and/or clicks may mean the content ranks well but doesn't match searcher intent

This list is suggestions. It is not exclusive. If you see other data indicating an opportunity, tell me.
