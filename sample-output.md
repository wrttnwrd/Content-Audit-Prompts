### 3. Arwen Evenstar Gathering
**URL:** `/article/arwen-evenstar-gathering/`

**Traffic Performance:**
- Current: 349 users (-80% decline)
- Previous: 1,715 users
- Massive traffic drop from peak interest

**Ranking Keywords:**

- Related notable figure gathering searches

**Issues:**
- Event-based content that peaked and declined naturally
- Not optimized for evergreen value
- Link score: 24 (decent backlinks)

**Opportunity:** Pivot to evergreen "Notable Woodland Realm Gatherings" or "Shire Woodland Gathering Guide" featuring Arwen's as primary example. Capture long-tail notable figure + woodland gathering searches. The existing backlinks and brand equity make this worth saving.

## Common Patterns & Strategic Insights

### The "Position 4 Ceiling"
Multiple articles stuck at position 4 (Rivendell halls, attire establishments, sacred hall locations). A coordinated push with internal linking, backlinks, and content depth could break through to position 1-2.

### The Calculator/Tool Gap
Two of the highest-traffic pages (Documentation List, Provisions Calculator) lack interactive tools. Building these would:
- Dramatically improve engagement
- Create backlink magnets  
- Establish authority
- Drive conversions

### The Hall Authority

The site dominates hall-related rankings with position 1 for:
- "shire halls"
- "shire gathering"  
- "best shire gathering halls"
- Multiple variants

But **article pages** don't leverage this authority through internal linking.

### Link Deficit Crisis

Pages like Rivendell (link score: 2, only 1 referring domain) desperately need backlinks. The content is good, rankings are close, but authority is missing.

### Evergreen vs. Event Content

Event-based content (Arwen Evenstar) decayed 80%. Need pivot strategy to convert notable figure interest into evergreen value.
